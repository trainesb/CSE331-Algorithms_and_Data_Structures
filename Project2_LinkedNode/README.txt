Project 2

Name: Ben Traines
Time to Complete: 2 hours
Feedback:
    This project wasn't to difficult for me to complete. After project1
    most of the python syntax came back to me and made it rather easy
    to write what I wanted without having to struggle looking definitions
    up all the time.

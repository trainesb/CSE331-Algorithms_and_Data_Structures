Project 5


Name: Ben Traines

Time to Complete: ~5hr

    This assignment was rather fun, because it wasn't super difficult
    while at the same time really teaching me how storing and calling data works.
    I didn't use any Sources besides for proj4 to copy some documentation, I used
    functions from proj4 as templates for proj5, as well as used proj5 piazza forum
    to help get a better idea on some of the functions, other students were having
    trouble with.

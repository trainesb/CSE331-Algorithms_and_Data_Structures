Project Binary Min Heap and Sort


Name: Ben Traines

Time to Complete: ~4 hours
    The lecture notes, specifically lecture 17 was very helpful to complete a lot of main functions. After that, as long
    as i slowed down and understood how the function worked it was easy to complete.

Sources Used:
    percolate_down, percolate_up, swap, pop_min, heap_push, has_left, has_right, right_child, left_child, parent:
    Used all of Lecture 17 Notes on D2L for these functions. (https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/content/696871/viewContent/6804352/View?ou=696871)

	`LinkedList.py` contains the class LinkedList() which is a list of Nodes connected on the tail. The LinkedList had several functions such as;
	    -push_back(val) adds a node of val to the end of the list,
	    -push_front(val) which can be used to add Nodes of val to the front of a list,
	    -length() to return the size of the list,
	    -count(val) to git the number of matches for a val, that are in the list,
	    -is_empty() will return True if the list is empty, False otherwise,
	    -front_value() returns the head of the list,
	    -back_value() returns the tail of the list,
	    -find(val) returns true if val exists in the list, False otherwise
	    -pop_front() removes and returns the first item in the List
	    -pop_back() removes and returns the last item in the list
	    -reverse_list() Sorts the list in reverse order
